# Where is waldo

It's a game where user need to find the given characters in a highly populated image. I have made 3 levels for this game where each level is harder than other one. I have added a features where user can see how much time does they took to find all the characters and also they can save their timing. This game also features a leaderboard where user can see other person timings.
